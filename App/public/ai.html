    <h2>Radisys</h2>
   <p> Radisys as a video conferencing platform is AI driven in and of itself. With built in sentiment analysis. It has built in features to augment eLearning services, as well as virtual assistants that could be supercharged with the implementation of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT or Bard. With its REST API framework and audiovisual communications platform, integrating its services into an AI-driven application would greatly augment the learning experience. With its SMS capacity and its TTS framework, one can easily subscribe to notifications of learn room joins and keyword notifications throughout the platform, as well as integrating voice and video with a plain text chat client that all seamlessly integrate into one UI/UX experience.</p>

        <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>
            ChatGPT and Bard both have their strengths, with ChatGPT being very strong in its existing informational delivery method, but requires necessary retraining. Its API functionality is nearly endless, due to its integration with many, many open source frameworks.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>Bard</h2>
        <p>Bard is a very newly deployed platform that is currently lagging behind ChatGPT, but provides a far more natural conversation, as well as the capacity to access live research and learn live. It has the capacity to rapidly catch up with ChatGPT, if not potentially surpass it, due to its ability to learn live and never forget anything it experiences real time, as is its neuroplasticity.</p>
