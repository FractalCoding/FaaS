            <h2>Agile Infrastructure<h2></h2>
            This app hopes to grow and scale and its cloud native nature will allow it to be highly scalable upon agile infrastructure, which means the app can very, very easily grow as needed. If IAM roles and permissions are set up correctly, then it is very easy to grow a team around this application and its development, and it is very easy to add and remove components as necessary.
    <h2>Pay-with-your-Data</h2>
    <p>
            The scale and importance of this application is potentially limitless, and the app can be offered as a free service in return for massive amounts of data collection which could be used to further improve instructional AI and thus further improve the sites performance and usability. 
        </p>
        <h2>Shifting the Paradigm</h2>
    <p>
        There simply does not exist a SaaS that allows for a P2P conference shared learning platform. With the advent of AI, and the pace of AI rapidly accelerating, we can absolutely revolutionize the way we learn, especially as FaaS moves its model outward.
    
        Why is this app called Forklift as a Service? I want to be forklift certified, but I am unable to get my forklift certification freely. In a shared learning platform, I should be able to walk into an OSHA approved space like my local Maker Space, get trained and certified in forklift operation, and walk out with a certification, within a day's time, without needing a backstocking job. Therin lies the Forklift-as-a-Service model, the idea that direct industry grade certifications can be obtained or at least trained for in a P2P AI-driven crowd learning manner, much like how Maker Spaces operate, but with a higher organization driving a framework for learning, as well as maintaining industry standards to allow for official certifications to take place, such as forklift operation.
    
        AI is the future. Crowd learning is the future. P2P is the future. Agile IaaS is the future. When combined... we have a powerful force that will shift the paradigm to a whole new level.
