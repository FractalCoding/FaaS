# Forklift-as-a-Service
This repository is a shared learning platform called Forklift-as-a-Service. This app is part of TADHack 2023 and is my submission to such. Please read the readme for up to date details about this application.

The goals of this app are as follows:

1. Provide a shared learning platform powered by robust AI teachers that serve as an always available resource in a P2P learning platform.
2. Provide users with a way to develop lesson plans and to share lesson plans with others as part of a crowd learning initiative.
3. Be committed to FOSS and the open-source initiative in order to further encourage development of crowd learning platforms.
4. Bring the -aaS model to the real world with physical crowd learning spaces where people can get real world experience and even get certified in certain things they would not otherwise be able to get outside of specialized spaces (i.e. forklift certified--a la Forklift-as-a-Service)

This app aims to be a free service. However this app does cost money to host, which is why I am implementing a PWYD model--Pay With Your Data. Because this app aims to be a professional learning platform, all use of this platform must abide by our Terms and Conditions.

Your data will be used to further improve instructional AI learning models and will be very securely stored upon Google Cloud Platform in a very safe manner.

As of now, the platform aims to use ChatGPT as the basis for instructional AI; however, there are plans to switch over to Bard once its API becomes available.

If you live in a country that abides to such a law such as the GDPR, please build this software locally and host it as per your local laws and regulations regarding data privacy.

As part of transparency, once again, all of your data will be collected as part of a project to train instructional AI that will better improve this service. Please build and deploy this app locally if you wish to use this service and opt out of data collection.
