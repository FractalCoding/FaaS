<h1>Future Possibilities</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">v1.0.0 Early Development Alpha Build</p>
<div class = "myDiv">
    <p>
    This app is very ambitious. This app aims to eventually offer Platform-as-a-Service i.e. PaaS offerings. That is to say, nonprofit learning apps can be deployed to the service as part of an automated learning infrastructure program, allowing certain classrooms to interact with applications embedded in classroom conferences, that allow one to gain an active learning experience that would allow for a more immersive and guided learning experience. 

    The PaaS offering would be hosted on GCP App Engine, Cloud Run, GKE, or Cloud Functions, depending on the use case of the app.</p>

    <h2>App Engine</h2>
    <img src="./images/AppEngine.png" width = 600 height = auto />
    <br><p>
    App Engine would allow one to host robust apps that require high amount of computational power. This sort of PaaS offering would allow classrooms to perform study on dedicated applications, such as a simulated Arduino learning platform.

    These are ideal when entire classrooms are to learn mutually upon a single platform using a single UI.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Cloud Run</h2>
<img src="./images/CloudRun.png" width=600 height=auto />
<br><p>
Cloud Run would allow for very lightweight single container applications that are very agile and scalable. This is ideal for very small and lightweight apps that people in the same room can have their own copy of.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Google Kubernetes Engine</h2>
    <img src="./images/GKE.png" width = 600 height = auto />
    <br><p>
    GKE is a great PaaS offering for advanced applications that must be highly agile and scalable in order to best offer single user applications within the same learning environment. 

    This site is built upon GKE Autopilot, as a single pod deployment that allows for an external IP address to be generated. The elasticity of GKE allows for scale upon demand, allowing for learning applications to be deployed as necessary.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Cloud Functions</h2>
    <img src="./images/CloudFunctions.png" width=600 height=auto />
    <br>
<p>Cloud Functions would allow for rapid testing of code snippets and would be fantastic as a directly offered service, almost in REPL format, for coding learning environments. </p></div>
