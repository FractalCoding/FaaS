# Forklift-as-a-Service
This repository is a shared learning platform called Forklift-as-a-Service. This app is part of TADHack 2023 and is my submission to such. Please read the readme for up to date details about this application.

The goals of this app are as follows:

1. Provide a shared learning platform powered by robust AI teachers that serve as an always available resource in a P2P learning platform.
2. Provide users with a way to develop lesson plans and to share lesson plans with others as part of a crowd learning initiative.
3. Be committed to FOSS and the open-source initiative in order to further encourage development of crowd learning platforms.
4. Bring the -aaS model to the real world with physical crowd learning spaces where people can get real world experience and even get certified in certain things they would not otherwise be able to get outside of specialized spaces (i.e. forklift certified--a la Forklift-as-a-Service)
