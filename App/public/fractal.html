                    | My name is Fractal Hassan. I cannot
                    | describe myself by any other word past 
                    | “thinker” and “doer” for my 	
                    | love of all doctrines is endless. I live 
    Personal        | by three axioms: A) Always be yourself; B) 
                    | Respect all who respect others; and C) 
                    | Keep learning, and never stop learning. No

                    | do so with passion and for the sake of 
                    | learning and doing and do so with pure 
                    | love and compassion in my heart.
